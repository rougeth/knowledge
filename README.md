# Hello, World!

My name is [Marco Rougeth](https://rgth.co) and I created this Gitbook to share tips, lessons, algorithms, ideas, commands, programs, etc, related to software development and computer science in general.

You can open an issue or a pull request if you see something wrong or an example that could be better explained, here: [rougeth/knowledge](https://github.com/rougeth/knowledge).
